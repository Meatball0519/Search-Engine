Part 1 A:
Calculate Weighted PageRanks
Write a program in the file pagerank.c that reads data from a given collection of pages in the file collection.txt and builds a graph structure using Adjacency Matrix or List Representation. 

Using the algorithm described below, calculate Weighted PageRank for every url in the file collection.txt. 

In this file, urls are separated by one or more spaces or/and new line character. Add suffix .txt to a url to obtain file name of the corresponding "web page". For example, file url24.txt contains the required information for url24.
